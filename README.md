# deeplink

## usecase
Ever wondered how to use upi://pay deep link in google forms or Telegram or whatsapp?
Actually, its impossible to write html formatted text which accepts upi deeplink url.

## solution
Create a proxy which accepts all the parameters like pa, pn, am, tn and redirects to a constructed upi deeplink url.
Since this goes back to the mobile browser, it does the magic of asking which app to use or uses the default app configured for UPI.
